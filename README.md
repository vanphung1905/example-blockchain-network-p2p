# example-blockchain-network-p2p

This is a small research exercise about blockchain

## To test how a blockchain works:
```bash
node test_blockchain.js
```
## to test the blockchain model with a small p2p network
- run node is responsible for sending data:
```bash
node core.js
```
- run node join the network:
```bash
node core2.js
```
You can run core and core2 many times on many different terminals to see data synchronization
